###Teaching Tips from Byte Instructors

([Jeff](http://jeffmaxim.herokuapp.com/)) Use the [Jisaw Classroom](https://www.jigsaw.org) strategy. This will help students get to know eachother better on day 1 and help them get in a habit of reaching out to their classmates for help.

###In-Class Demonstration Ideas

Write the code snippet on the white board:
```
x = 0
for i in range(10):
    x += 1
```
Get an empty bowl. Explain that `x = 0` is declaring an empty storage container called `x` just like the bowl is an empty storage container. Explain that `x += 1` is like adding items to the bowl. Have some small item, like `m&m's`, and add them to the bowl to demonstrate.



###Thought Questions

Why do we need variables? What would happen to our programs if we couldn't use variables.
Specific example: How would we write a program that adds two numbers together if we didn't have access variables?
