# Don't Hesitate, Iterate!!!

#### Description

Practice makes perfect. Here's some practice with iteration with variables.

---

#### Challenge

* Write a for loop that will take in a number.
* When the loop is called it will iterate from `0` forward towards that number and print all the values in between to the terminal.
* Write another loop that will do the same thing but iterate backwards from that number to zero.

For example, if we have the following starter code:

```
def my_loop(x):
    # write your code here
    # you'll have to delete "pass"
    pass
```

You'll write a loop with the `my_loop` function that will iterate from 0 to x and print out all values in between. For example:
```
[input]
my_loop(10)

[output]
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```
In the next part, you'll write a function that will do the opposite. That is, you'll write the `my_reverse_loop` function that will contain a loop that will iterate from x to `0` and print out all the values in between. For example:
```
[input]
my_reverse_loop(5)

[output]
4
3
2
1
```
