#Fibonacci
---

#### Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers. Each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. Usually the first two numbers are 0, and 1

#### Objective 1

* Write a function that will take in a number as an argument
* It will print the fibonacci sequence up to that number

```
fib(10) 

// 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34
```

#### Objective 2

* Add on to function one so it will only return the even numbers in that sequence
