# Don't Hesitate, Iterate!!!

#### Description

Practice makes perfect. Here's a bunch of practice with iteration throughout the various data types

---

#### Objective 1

* Write a for loop that will take in a number
* When the loop is called it will iterate forward towards that number and print all the values in between to the console
* Write another loop that will do the same thing but iterate backwards from that number to zero

#### Objective 2

* Create a variable and assign it to an array of various data types
* Write a function that will take in this variable
* The function will loop through the array and print all the values to the console individually

#### Objective 3

* Create a variable and assign it to the array below

```
[2, 34, 12, 29, 38, 1, 12, 8, 8, 9, 29, 38, 8, 9, 2, 3, 7, 10, 12, 8, 34, 7]
```
* Write a function that will take in this variable
* It will return the median number in the array
* It will return the average of that array
* It will return the number that occurs most frequently in the array

#### Objective 4

* Create a variable and assign it to a random string of your choice
* Write a function that will take in that variable and return an output that is the string in reverse
