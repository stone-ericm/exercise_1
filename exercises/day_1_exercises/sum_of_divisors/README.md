# Divided We Fall
---

##### Description

* Divisors of a number are those numbers that divide it evenly; 

```
divisors of 60 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60
```
* Totatives of a number are numbers that are coprime to it. 
* Coprime - two numbers that have no common factor but 1

```
totatives of 30 = 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29
```
* Totient - the sum of the totatives

##### Objective 1

* Write a function that takes in a integer as an argument
* This function will return a list of the divisors of that integer

##### Objective 2

* Write another function that takes in an integer as an argument
* This function will return the sum of the divisors of that integer

##### Objective 3

* Write another function that takes in an integer as an argument
* This function will return the number of divisors the integer has

##### Objectives 4, 5, 6

* Write three more functions that will do the same as above, but for the integers totatives.
