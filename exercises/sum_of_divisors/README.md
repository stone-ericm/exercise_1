# Divided We Fall part 1
---

##### Description

* Divisors of a number are those numbers that divide it evenly;

```
divisors of 60 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60
```

##### Challenge

* Write a function that takes an integer as an argument, and returns a list with three elements.
* The first element is a list of the divisors of that integer.
* The second element is the sum of the divisors of that integer.
* The third element is the number of divisors the integer has.

#####Example
```
[input]
60

[output]
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60], 168, 12]
```

##### RESOURCES

* _Hint_: You can write seperate functions. Each function will create one of the elements of the list that you return. The functions can call each other!
