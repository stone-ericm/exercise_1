#### Description

Practice makes perfect. Here's some practice with iteration and lists.

---

#### Challenge

* Create a variable and assign it to a list of various data types.
* Write a function that will take in this variable.
* The function will loop through the list and print all the values to the terminal individually.

We're not giving you any starter code this time. Sorry! Checkout the starter code in `iteration with lists` for some example starter code that will help you setup this challenge.

Here's some example `input` and `output`:

```
[input]
[1, 2, ['jeff', 'tom'], [42, ['billy', 'jason']]]

[output]
1
2
jeff
tom
42
billy
jason
```
